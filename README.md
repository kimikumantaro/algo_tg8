## PART 1 - Implement the sorting algorithm

Given the following array A = [84, 23, 62, 44, 16, 30, 95, 51], implement a program to sort the array using the following algorithm:

a) Counting Sort

b) Radix Sort

Provide the pseudocode, implement the algorithm using Python, explain the codes/algorithm, and explain running time complexity of each algorithm.

## PART 2 - Implement the string-matching algorithm

Given a String “algorithmisfun”, search for the word “fun” in the String by applying the following algorithms:

a) Rabin-Karp Algorithm

b) KMP Algorithm

c) TRIES

Provide the pseudocode, implement the algorithm using Python, explain the codes/algorithm, and explain running time complexity of each algorithm.
